I had the honor of working with Shubhra on a variety of LFX initiatives and projects.

I admired his passion in all his work and sense of committment to the LF and open source community.

Also, I respected him so much for his drive and support of his team, growing them and taking care of them, even across organizations.

You will be missed, rest in peace.

The brightest, friendliest smile in the room was always Shubhra’s.  

While our paths only intersected for a brief time, I can say it was truly an honor to work with this man.  He was the kind of leader and friend who would pull me aside to offer perspectives that could accelerate a plan forward or help us avoid stepping into a hole that might set us back.  

While his ambitions were strong, his approach was never self-centered nor was he ever one to brag of his personal accomplishments.  

He embodied team spirit - always willing to lend a hand, put in an extra effort, give credit to others, and seek opportunities that would enable others around him to shine.  You don’t come across leaders like him everyday. 

My heart goes out to his wife, children, family and friends in these difficult times ahead.  His spirit remains Shubhra’s with all of us. Rest In Peace, my friend.
